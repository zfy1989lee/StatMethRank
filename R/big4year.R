#' Data on the big four EPL Teams
#' 
#' The English Premier League (EPL) is a famous professional league for association 
#' soccer clubs in the UK. The so-called "Big Four" soccer clubs are Arsenal, Chelsea, 
#' Liverpool, and Manchester United, have dominated the top four spots since the 1996-1997 
#' season. Wikipedia documented the results of the "Big Four" since the start of the 
#' Premier League in the 1992-93 season. The rankings of these four English Premier 
#' League teams from the 1992-93 season to the2012-13 season are listed in this data frame. 
#' The first row of the data means that there is one season that Arsenal ranked at the 
#' top of EPL, Chelsea the second, Manchester United the third and Liverpool the fourth. 
#' We may test the hypothesis that the rankings observed are random. On the other hand, 
#' through the use of modeling we may try to determine how the rankings cluster.
