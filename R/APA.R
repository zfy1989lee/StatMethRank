#' In 1980, the American Psychological Association conducted an election at which five candidates (A, B, C, D and E) were 
#' running  for president and voters were asked to rank order all of the candidates. Among those voters, 5738 gave complete 
#' rankings. These complete rankings are considered here. The data are given in Diaconis (1988). Suppose that lower rank 
#' implies more favorable.
