The so-called \"Big Four\" soccer clubs are Arsenal, Chelsea,\nLiverpool, and Manchester United, have dominated the top four spots since the 1996-1997\nseason. Wikipedia documented the results of the \"Big Four\" since the start of the\nPremier League in the 1992-93 season. The rankings of these four English Premier\nLeague teams from the 1992-93 season to the2012-13 season are listed in this data frame.\nThe first row of the data means that there is one season that Arsenal ranked at the\ntop of EPL, Chelsea the second, Manchester United the third and Liverpool the fourth.\nWe may test the hypothesis that the rankings observed are random. On the other hand,\nthrough the use of modeling we may try to determine how the rankings cluster.\n}\n\\details{\n\\itemize{\n  \\item Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, and Manchester United.
