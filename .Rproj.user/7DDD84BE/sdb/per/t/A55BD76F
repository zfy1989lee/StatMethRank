The rankings of these four English Premier \n#' League teams from the 1992-93 season to the2012-13 season are listed in this data frame. \n#' The first row of the data means that there is one season that Arsenal ranked at the \n#' top of EPL, Chelsea the second, Manchester United the third and Liverpool the fourth. \n#' We may test the hypothesis that the rankings observed are random. On the other hand, \n#' through the use of modeling we may try to determine how the rankings cluster.\n#' \n#' \\itemize{\n#'   \\item Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, and Manchester United.
