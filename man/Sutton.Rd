\description{
In a survey conducted in Florida, C.Sutton asked a group of female elderly for 14
white and 13 black retired women aged 70-79 "with which sex do you prefer to spend
your leisure?" Each elderly ranked the three choices: A: male(s), B: female(s),
C: both sexes, assigning rank 1 to the most desired choice, rank 2 to the next most
desired rank 3 to the least desired choice. The first object in the ranking corresponds
to "male", the second to "female" and the third to "both". It was desired to compare
these two groups on leisure preferences and attitudes on retirement of the elderly.
