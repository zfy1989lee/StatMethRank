\description{
The "song" data set from Critchlow et al. (1991). Ninety-eight students
were asked to rank 5 words, (1) score, (2) instrument, (3) solo, (4) benediction
and (5) suit, according to the association with the word "song". However,
the available data given in Critchlow et al. (1991) is in grouped format and
the ranking of 15 students are unknown and hence discarded, resulting in 83
rankings.
